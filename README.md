# Introduction
Final project of Machine Learning: reinforcement learning algorithm for MCS selection

# Package requirements
- Python version: 3.7
- gym version: 10.0

# How to run it?
1. Train model then test policy net.
Just run main.py, it will train the value network and policy network and then save a model. After that, it will test the policy learned.
2. Test the policy directly.
Just comment Line 10~11 in main.py, and then run main.py.
